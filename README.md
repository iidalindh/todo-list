# Todo-list

---

_This is my first Javascript-project. This is a school-project for the Javascript Basic course on Medieinstitutet in Stockholm, Sweden._

## Installation

---

1. Run 'git clone https://github.com/iidalindh/todo-list.git' in your terminal

## Codestyle

---

**Variables** is written with camelCase and **Classes** with PascalCase.

### camelCase:

let currentTodoItem = toDoList[i];

### Pascal Case:

class ToDoValues {
constructor(\_name, \_checked, \_createDate) {
this.name = \_name;
this.checked = \_checked;
this.createDate = \_createDate;
}
}
