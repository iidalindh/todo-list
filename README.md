# Todo-list

This is my first Javascript-project. This is a school-project for Javascript Basic course.

codestyle: Variables is written with camelCase and classes with PascalCase.

## camelCase:

let currentTodoItem = toDoList[i];

## Pascal Case:

class ToDoValues {
constructor(\_name, \_checked, \_createDate) {
this.name = \_name;
this.checked = \_checked;
this.createDate = \_createDate;
}
}
